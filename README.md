### Friendly Neighborhood Notice

This game is a one level recreation of the original Andro Dunos. It has been developed by 5 first year students at the UPC as a project,
it is not and never will be intended for commertial use (Being a recreation and all). The game uses existing assets: In other words, we only worried about coding and QA.
Since it has been coded by first year students, criticism is welcomed and even encouraged! Provided it is constructive criticism.

### The Game

Andro Dunos is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up developed by Japan based Visco Games Corporation, set in the far future
where you play the role of an ace pilot in a sci-fi combat ship designed with 4 (way, laser, 
home, rear) weapon settings which the player can switch to at any moment of gameplay. The player, with the help 
of these weapons and of enemy ship dropped power-ups, must shoot their way through mobs of enemies and bosses
to advance through levels and defeat the alien invaders of the Earth.

### Game Rules:

	1. Both players have three lives.
	2. You win if you manage to survive the whole level without dying.
	3. If one of the two players die, the game is over.
